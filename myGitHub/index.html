			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6 pt-2">
					<p>Chase is a first year Multimedia and Production Diploma student at the Lethbridge College. In his spare time, he loves to play Minecraft with his friends. He loves to create servers to share and play on with his friends and because of the ability to refine his skills in Adobe Dreamweaver, he uses his skill to now create texture packs and mod packs for the game. He plans to use the skills that he is gaining to further a career in photography, video game development and web design. Chase also works with The Skipping Stones Foundation which is a non-profit organization that is based in Calgary, Alberta. He is working with them to try and improve the medical field for the transgender community in Southern Alberta. Chase also started the first ever Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) club at his high school in his grade 11 year, growing up in a very conservative farmer/rancher community, he was faced with a lot of diversity before reaching his end goal. Outside of school you can find Chase gaming on his PC, spending time with his friends and family or going for walks in nature with his adorable fur baby Rallo. The person that inspires Chase the most is his mother, Michelle. His mother has been his biggest motivator and inspiration for everything that Chase has done. Despite coming from a broken home and being raised by a single mother, Chase uses that turmoil as fuel to achieve his goals.</p>

					<h5>Reality</h5>
						<i class="fas fa-mountain fa-2x pb-2"></i>
						<p>When Chase does not have his nose stuck in his PC you can find him seeking all kinds of adventures. From climbing to the peaks of some of the tallest mountains in Canada during the summer, to cruising down those same mountains stapped to a snowboard in the winter.</p>
						<p>Growing up in the small city of Medicine Hat, there was not a lot of options for ski resorts. About 45 minutes of out city limits there is a small ski lodge called Hidden Valley Ski Resort. That is where Chase's thrill for adventure first began.</p>
