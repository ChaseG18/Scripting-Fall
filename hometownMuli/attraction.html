					<h5>The Red Cliffs</h5>
					<p>If you happen to find yourself down by the South Saskatchewan River, take a glance to see if you can spot how Redcliff got its name. Lining the river there are beautiful red cliffs. Layered with multiple different shades of pink, red and orange. On a sunny day, you will not only get to witness all of colors sparkle as they reflect the light, but you will also see the wildlife that has found shelter in the cracks and crevasses. </p>

					<h5>The Clay Pits</h5>
					<p>If you happen to stroll down the red trail just on outside the golf course, keep an eye out to see if you can find the hidden secrets and paths that will take you deeper into the coulees. Some have said that it is almost like going to a different planet. Finding the magnificent red cliffs that stretch as far as the eye can see, and the clay pits that almost make you feel like you are walking on the moon. With the light grey dried clay, with grooves that tell its story of where it originally came from. Curves that dance around the hills and rocks, creating patterns and a hundred different textures. Every once and a while you may find a sinkhole, falling so deep that they look like they may go down to the core of the Earth. Caused by coal mines that were used in the 1880â€™s, collapsing after all the years of erosion and rainfall. </p>

					<h5>The Avenue Of Trees</h5>
					<p>The first historical attraction that you will see is the beautiful avenue of trees. Two long rows of huge trunks with gorgeous ever-growing branches, bursting with leaves. Planted there by hand in 1945 by students at the local school. They place 218 trees, each one to honor those that served in WWII. Then take a left at Mitchell Street and you come to the remanence of the Redcliff Brick Factory, built in 1906 when the second coal mine begun in Redcliff. Recently, the structure has been demolished for safety reasons, but you are still welcome to come walk around and learn about how the factory was run.</p>
