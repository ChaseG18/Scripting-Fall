					<p>The small town of Redcliff is located just outside of The City of Medicine Hat in southern Alberta. With a near 15-minute drive to the city center, this rural town is perfect for young families or those looking for the city lifestyle without all the noise and chaos. Driving into the town you will pass by two a row of large trees. Taller than most houses, with long blossoming branches that hug the road. Almost like they are welcoming you home every time you pass them. </p>

					<p>The name Redcliff comes from the breath-taking valleys the line the riverbank. The cliffs stretch for as long as the eye can see, with a beautiful arrange of all different shades of red, orange and pink. All interlaced together to make a mosaic masterpiece. If you happen to take a stroll along the red shale path, you find some off-road trails. They will take you to what feels like a different planet, the younger generations call it the “clay pits”.  Out there you can see jaw dropping scenery. As you walk across the hardened clay you will pass by sinkholes that started to become more common in Redcliff in the 1880s. These sinkholes started because of an abundant of coal and natural gas reserve that happened to be and still is embedded in the ground.</p>
